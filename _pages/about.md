In my physics class, I was deeply fascinated by complex circuit logic. To translate the knowledge of Ohm's Law and other concepts from textbooks into real-world problem-solving skills, I launched this small-scale project called 'AppliedFix'. It's not just a repair service; it's my experimental ground for exploring how technology can improve lives.

This project currently operates under my parents' technical supervision, providing appliance testing and simple repair services to our community neighbors during my free time. We advocate the environmentally friendly concept of "repairing instead of replacing," charging only for basic material costs.

Through this website, I will document the joy of every successful repair and honestly reflect on the lessons learned from every failure. I hope that through this continuous documentation, I can cultivate rigorous engineering thinking and a sense of responsibility towards my community."
